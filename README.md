# Basic Digital Design 

A couple of basic digital design projects completed during EE coursework.

# Speech Signal Processing
Senior Design in Signal Processing Using MATLAB
1) Speech Synthesis using LPC Analysis
2) Speech Recognition using Vector Quantization

# EE 490 Design in Using MATLAB & VHDL
Initial proof-of-concept design was acheived in MATLAB, before migrating to VHDL.
Code provided is for portability between MATLAB and VHDL and some key modules designed.
1) Fixed point to binary conversion of decimals to 16-bit precision.
2) Binary to fixed point conversion
3) Moving Average Filter using Circular Buffering
